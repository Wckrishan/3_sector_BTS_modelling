# 3_sector_BTS_modelling
Developed a Python-based simulation of a 3-sectored base station to evaluate downlink performance, including coverage, interference, and throughput using COST231, shadowing, and fading models.
Materialized modular algorithms for computing RSL, EIRP, and user mobility, achieving a 90% accuracy rate in analyzing call setups, handoffs, and drops under real-world conditions.
Generated performance insights with 100% analysis of S/I statistics and throughput graphs and road configurations
